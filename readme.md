Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- 复制.env.example为.env
- 配置.env里的数据库连接信息
- composer update
- php artisan migrate
- php artisan db:seed
- 登录后台：host/admin   帐号：root  密码：123456
